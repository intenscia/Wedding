# Wedding
A basic [wedding website](http://becandscotttietheknot.com/) I created for myself and Bec using the Bulma CSS framework, Particles.js, jQuery.countdown, Google Satisfy Font and FontAwesome icons.

## Usage
You are welcome to use this template for your own wedding site, but please make sure you change the details! We don't want our photos all over the internet if at all possible.

## Hosted by
Huge thanks to Github pages, makes it so easy to host static websites like this!
